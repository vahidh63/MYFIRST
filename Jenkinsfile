//            BUILD_DISPLAY_NAME
// The display name of the current build, which is something like "#153" by default.
// JOB_NAME
// Name of the project of this build, such as "foo" or "foo/bar".
// JOB_BASE_NAME
// Short Name of the project of this build stripping off folder paths, such as "foo" for "bar/foo".
// BUILD_TAG
// String of "jenkins-${JOB_NAME}-${BUILD_NUMBER}". All forward slashes ("/") in the JOB_NAME are replaced with dashes ("-"). Convenient to put into a resource file, a jar file, etc for easier identification.
// EXECUTOR_NUMBER
// The unique number that identifies the current executor (among executors of the same machine) thatâ€™s carrying out this build. This is the number you see in the "build executor status", except that the number starts from 0, not 1.
// NODE_NAME
// Name of the agent if the build is on an agent, or "master" if run on master
// NODE_LABELS
// Whitespace-separated list of labels that the node is assigned.
// WORKSPACE
// The absolute path of the directory assigned to the build as a workspace.
// JENKINS_HOME
// The absolute path of the directory assigned on the master node for Jenkins to store data.
// JENKINS_URL
// Full URL of Jenkins, like http://server:port/jenkins/ (note: only available if Jenkins URL set in system configuration)
// BUILD_URL
// Full URL of this build, like http://server:port/jenkins/job/foo/15/ (Jenkins URL must be set)
// JOB_URL
// Full URL of this job, like http://server:port/jenkins/job/foo/ (Jenkins URL must be set)
// GIT_COMMIT
// The commit hash being checked out.
// GIT_PREVIOUS_COMMIT
// The hash of the commit last built on this branch, if any.

// GIT_BRANCH
// The remote branch name, if any.
// GIT_LOCAL_BRANCH
// The local branch name being checked out, if applicable.
// GIT_CHECKOUT_DIR
// The directory that the repository will be checked out to. This contains the value set in Checkout to a sub-directory, if used.
// GIT_URL
// The remote URL. If there are multiple, will be GIT_URL_1, GIT_URL_2, etc.
// GIT_COMMITTER_NAME
// The configured Git committer name, if any, that will be used for FUTURE commits from the current workspace. It is read from the Global Config user.name Value field of the Jenkins Configure System page.
// GIT_AUTHOR_NAME
// The configured Git author name, if any, that will be used for FUTURE commits from the current workspace. It is read from the Global Config user.name Value field of the Jenkins Configure System page.
// GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL
